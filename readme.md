### <Changed> Yeoman Angular app with support for multiple modules
In my actual work, we found the need for angular scaffolding to have different modules under one parent directory. This will enable better code re-use and code organization.

Also, a lot of people have this on their wishlist. See https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular/issues/109

Feedback is definitely appreciated, which will help me gather energy to improve this project.

With this project, I tried to work as closely as possible to the original yeoman code, instead of creating a new generator. I also tried to minimize the additional prompts so as
not to defeat the purpose of scaffolding.

(Also, I'm a noob to NodeJS, so suggestions to improve the code are also welcome).

### <Changed> Module Name
The module name is a required parameter for the generator. It allows structuring of different modules under one parent directory. Each generator will ask for a module name, which translates to a sub-directory to put those files under.

For example, if module name given was "module1"...

```
yo angular:app module1
```

...then app-specific files will be generated as

```
modules
 |_  module1
       |_ scripts
       |   |_ controllers/mainCtrl.js
       |_ views/main.html
       |_ index.html
       |_ etc
 _    scripts (bower components)
       |_ angular/angular.js
       |_ etc
```

The information about the name of the module and the path to the actual directory is stored in a generated "modulesConfig.json"

Each sub-generator will also be prompted for the name of an existing module to generate those files into.

### <Changed> srcPath and testPath
There is an option to pass a srcPath and testPath, which will be another directory structure before the "modules" directory. I come from a Java background, and I created this
feature to help Maven users to have a "src/main/webapp/" for source and "src/test/webapp" for test structure before the modules directory.
"bower_components" directory name where angular components are generated were changed to "scripts"

### <Changed> Unchangeable file conventions (for now)
Each javacript filename will be generated with a suffix (i.e. Ctrl.js for controllers, Service.js for services, etc)
The name of the "modules" directory cannot be changed for now...
Once one module is generated, the srcPath and testPath cannot be changed anymore...(which makes sense for my needs but maybe not for others)

### <Changed> TO-DO list
This is only a side-project that I can only work on when I have some free time, and so there are still a lot of stuff I need to do to make this project "Production-quality".

Update the unit tests
Module overwrite prompt ONLY WORKS ONCE
Support generation of npmrc and bowerrc with proxies entered from the prompt
Update Gruntfile.js to have all modules' files included
Support Angular UI-router
Update CoffeeScript templates (not using coffee right now so this is low priority)
Remove prompts for overwrite of bower.json, package.json and modulesConfig.json


## Original documentation from yeoman follows...
# AngularJS generator [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-angular.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-angular) [![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)

> Yeoman generator for AngularJS - lets you quickly set up a project with sensible defaults and best practises.
> Forked generator that allows creation of modules. The module name is a required prompt.

## Usage

Install `generator-angular`:
```
npm install -g generator-angular
```

Make a new directory, and `cd` into it:
```
mkdir my-new-project && cd $_
```

Run `yo angular`, optionally passing an app name:
```
yo angular [app-name]
```

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview


## Generators

Available generators:

* [angular](#app) (aka [angular:app](#app))
* [angular:controller](#controller)
* [angular:directive](#directive)
* [angular:filter](#filter)
* [angular:route](#route)
* [angular:service](#service)
* [angular:provider](#service)
* [angular:factory](#service)
* [angular:value](#service)
* [angular:constant](#service)
* [angular:decorator] (#decorator)
* [angular:view](#view)

**Note: Generators are to be run from the root directory of your app.**

### App
Sets up a new AngularJS app, generating all the boilerplate you need to get started. The app generator also optionally installs Twitter Bootstrap and additional AngularJS modules, such as angular-resource (installed by default).

Example:
```bash
yo angular
```

### Route
Generates a controller and view, and configures a route in `app/scripts/app.js` connecting them.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:route myroute
```

Produces `app/scripts/controllers/myroute.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').controller('MyrouteCtrl', function ($scope) {
  // ...
});
```

Produces `app/views/myroute.html`:
```html
<p>This is the myroute view</p>
```

### Controller
Generates a controller in `app/scripts/controllers`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:controller user
```

Produces `app/scripts/controllers/user.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').controller('UserCtrl', function ($scope) {
  // ...
});
```
### Directive
Generates a directive in `app/scripts/directives`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:directive myDirective
```

Produces `app/scripts/directives/myDirective.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').directive('myDirective', function () {
  return {
    template: '<div></div>',
    restrict: 'E',
    link: function postLink(scope, element, attrs) {
      element.text('this is the myDirective directive');
    }
  };
});
```

### Filter
Generates a filter in `app/scripts/filters`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:filter myFilter
```

Produces `app/scripts/filters/myFilter.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').filter('myFilter', function () {
  return function (input) {
    return 'myFilter filter:' + input;
  };
});
```

### View
Generates an HTML view file in `app/views`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:view user
```

Produces `app/views/user.html`:
```html
<p>This is the user view</p>
```

### Service
Generates an AngularJS service.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:service myService
```

Produces `app/scripts/services/myService.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').service('myService', function () {
  // ...
});
```

You can also do `yo angular:factory`, `yo angular:provider`, `yo angular:value`, and `yo angular:constant` for other types of services.

### Decorator
Generates an AngularJS service decorator.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:decorator serviceName
```

Produces `app/scripts/decorators/serviceNameDecorator.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').config(function ($provide) {
    $provide.decorator('serviceName', function ($delegate) {
      // ...
      return $delegate;
    });
  });
```

## Options
In general, these options can be applied to any generator, though they only affect generators that produce scripts.

### CoffeeScript
For generators that output scripts, the `--coffee` option will output CoffeeScript instead of JavaScript.

For example:
```bash
yo angular:controller user --coffee
```

Produces `app/scripts/controller/user.coffee`:
```coffeescript
angular.module('myMod')
  .controller 'UserCtrl', ($scope) ->
```

A project can mix CoffeScript and JavaScript files.

To output JavaScript files, even if CoffeeScript files exist (the default is to output CoffeeScript files if the generator finds any in the project), use `--coffee=false`.

### Minification Safe

**Deprecated**

[Related Issue #452](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular/issues/452): This option is being removed in future versions of the generator. Initially it was needed as ngMin was not entirely stable. As it has matured, the need to keep separate versions of the script templates has led to extra complexity and maintenance of the generator. By removing these extra burdens, new features and bug fixes should be easier to implement. If you are dependent on this option, please take a look at ngMin and seriously consider implementing it in your own code. It will help reduce the amount of typing you have to do (and look through) as well as make your code cleaner to look at.


By default, generators produce unannotated code. Without annotations, AngularJS's DI system will break when minified. Typically, these annotations that make minification safe are added automatically at build-time, after application files are concatenated, but before they are minified. By providing the `--minsafe` option, the code generated will out-of-the-box be ready for minification. The trade-off is between amount of boilerplate, and build process complexity.

#### Example
```bash
yo angular:controller user --minsafe
```

Produces `app/controller/user.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').controller('UserCtrl', ['$scope', function ($scope) {
  // ...
}]);
```

#### Background
Unannotated:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').controller('MyCtrl', function ($scope, $http, myService) {
  // ...
});
```

Annotated:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').controller('MyCtrl',
  ['$scope', '$http', 'myService', function ($scope, $http, myService) {

    // ...
  }]);
```

The annotations are important because minified code will rename variables, making it impossible for AngularJS to infer module names based solely on function parameters.

The recommended build process uses `ngmin`, a tool that automatically adds these annotations. However, if you'd rather not use `ngmin`, you have to add these annotations manually yourself. **One thing to note is that `ngmin` does not produce minsafe code for things that are not main level elements like controller, services, providers, etc.:
```javascript
resolve: {
  User: function(myService) {
    return MyService();
  }
}
```

will need to be manually done like so:
```javascript
resolve: {
  User: ['myService', function(myService) {
    return MyService();
  }]
}
```


### Add to Index
By default, new scripts are added to the index.html file. However, this may not always be suitable. Some use cases:

* Manually added to the file
* Auto-added by a 3rd party plugin
* Using this generator as a subgenerator

To skip adding them to the index, pass in the skip-add argument:
```bash
yo angular:service serviceName --skip-add
```

## Bower Components

The following packages are always installed by the [app](#app) generator:

* angular
* angular-mocks
* angular-scenario


The following additional modules are available as components on bower, and installable via `bower install`:

* angular-cookies
* angular-loader
* angular-resource
* angular-sanitize

All of these can be updated with `bower update` as new versions of AngularJS are released.

## Configuration
Yeoman generated projects can be further tweaked according to your needs by modifying project files appropriately.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
